    "#### Since Toronto is the most populated city of Canada, and one of the more important business centres in Canada, we would finalize the city to start with as Toronto based on secondary research on the internet.  The objective now is to find a suitable location/area in Toronto to open the 1st restaurant and also look for potential expansion locations \n",
